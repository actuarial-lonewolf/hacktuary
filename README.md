## Important Note: R Packages 

This shiny application was built between April and August 2022.  
While it is normal to have R packages being routinely updated, it appears that two updated packages are breaking some display parameters and icons.

Therefore, until the code is fixed to accomodate for the new packages, please run this shiny application using:   

`install.packages("https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/fontawesome/fontawesome_0.2.2.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")`  
`install.packages("https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/flexdashboard/flexdashboard_0.5.2.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")`
